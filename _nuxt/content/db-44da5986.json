However, the standard entry point used by current systems is keyword based search - an entry point incompatible with proven methods of scholarly close reading. Close reading is a key element in the pursuit of research questions focussing on complex or abstract concepts. In these situations keyword search based entry point often proves to be very restrictive, making it difficult, if not impossible, to formulate adequate search criteria and queries. Here we present a machine assisted close reading tool called <a href=\"https://research-software.nl/software/evidence\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Evidence</a>. It provides an alternative, intuitive entry point into collections.</p>\n<p>Evidence uses machine learning to extract a vector-space representation of the theme and content of all corpus elements. Using Evidence, users can query the corpus starting from elements embodying their research question. We call this concept-based querying. Additionally, Evidence allows classical word-based querying. This enables the user to search a large, digitised corpus with a focus on complex or abstract research questions. In this way Evidence assists the user's close reading.</p>\n<p>This presentation provides the audience with the relevant background and shows what Evidence is capable of.</p>\n<h2 id=\"architecture-and-underlying-principles-of-the-clariah-media-suite-annotation-tools\"><a href=\"#architecture-and-underlying-principles-of-the-clariah-media-suite-annotation-tools\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Architecture and underlying principles of the CLARIAH Media Suite annotation tools</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-open-standards-improve-the-publication--exchange-of-your-annotation-data\"><a href=\"#how-open-standards-improve-the-publication--exchange-of-your-annotation-data\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>How open standards improve the publication &#x26; exchange of (your) annotation data.</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CLARIAH Media Suite</a> serves media scholars and other (digital) humanities scholars by providing access to several (Dutch) audiovisual collections, such as television &#x26; radio programmes, films, newspapers and oral history interviews.

However, given the uncertainty of the COVID situation, we do not think it is wise to encourage people to travel to a central location. For this reason, as a compromise, we would like to organise this event as a collection of connected local events ([Hub & spoke model](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-hub-spoke-hybrid-live-events-re-engage-your-people-thewlis/)), with small local events connected to each other for a shared programme.

The emergence of research software has gone hand in hand with a strong growth in people who actually *develop *research software. Today, the UK at least counts more than [800 ](http://rse.ac.uk/)of professionals who identify as developers of software for research purposes. But for the Netherlands, we don’t know. Sure, we know that there are at least [40 people](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/people) actively developing and applying research software in close collaboration with university researchers. But there are many more people throughout the country working on software, managing data, and supporting digital research, distributed over various research institutes, universities, and other knowledge organizations.\n\nTo strengthen the various communities and to increase interaction between them, we have taken the initiative to start the Research Software Engineer (RSE) community in the Netherlands. It is inspired by the successful [UK-RSE Association](http://rse.ac.uk/), as well as the inspirational visits to the *First conference of Research Software Engineers* in 2016, events organized by the Software Sustainability Institute, and encounters with UK-RSE and [DE-RSE](http://www.de-rse.org) members.\n\n## Why the term Research Software Engineer (RSE)?\n\nWithout a name, it is difficult to refer to a group of people that share a set of skills and characteristics. A name must be descriptive, yet short enough to be meaningful. It must differentiate and be acceptable to both the people who identify with it and the academic community. In 2012, when trying to form a community of people working on software in academia in the UK, a lot of thought and discussion went into what term to use. Eventually, the new name was created by fusing the two skills that make it unique: an understanding of both research *and *software engineering. Quoting from the paper that marked the start of the Research Software Engineer community in the UK:\n> *Research institutions need individuals with a new professional designation — the research software engineer. These individuals combine a professional attitude to the exercise of software engineering with a deep understanding of research topics. They lead the design and construction of increasingly complex research software systems, and play an important part in the co-design of research requirements, understanding and addressing software engineering questions that arise in research planning. *[[Baxter et al., 2012](http://digital-research-2012.oerc.ox.ac.uk/papers/the-research-software-engineer/at_download/file)]\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4096/1*XWCrOtVijQ8gqcEWKuWMBA.jpeg)\n\nRSEs are often embedded in research groups in small teams, or even by themselves, working hard on the software, algorithms, tools and interfaces that facilitate cutting-edge research. And in many cases, they are academic researchers at the same time, holding positions as (assistant/associate) professor, postdoc or PhD candidate. RSEs closely collaborate with researchers to understand the challenges they face, and then develop research software to provide the answers. Some have started as researchers who spent a lot of time developing software to do their research. Others have started as software developers who have developed a strong affinity with scientific research.\n\n## Building the Community\n\nEarly 2017, ePlan and the eScience Center took the first steps to found NL-RSE. While we hope that the community will run independently at some point, for the time being a few enthusiastic organizations and partner organizations will take care of NL-RSE best we can. Upon learning of our plans, a number of organizations and individuals have already confirmed their interest in supporting NL-RSE. We are very happy to be joined by DTL in setting up NL-RSE, and hope others will follow. Be sure to send us an e-mail ([info@nl-rse.org](mailto:info@nl-rse.org)) if you are interested in supporting NL-RSE!\n\nAlthough supported by a number of organizations, the NL-RSE community consists of individuals self-identifying as Research Software Engineers. We feel this is the only way to truly build a community.\n\nThe centrepiece of the community is the mailing list. Rather than a newsletter governed by a communication department, any member can send messages to the entire community to make announcements. We also have created a [Slack Group](https://nl-rse.slack.com/) for discussions, and a [website ](http://nl-rse.org)with information.\n\n![“Better software better research” — slogan by the Software Sustainability Institute in the UK. [https://software.ac.uk/about](https://software.ac.uk/about)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*5xwpuYVUP73eMdxb7g5dyg.jpeg)*“Better software better research” — slogan by the Software Sustainability Institute in the UK. [https://software.ac.uk/about](https://software.ac.uk/about)*\n\nThe main goal of NL-RSE is to build a community of Research Software Engineers in the Netherlands, build best practices, and learn from each other. Note that NL-RSE is about engineering of research software, rather than research on software engineering, a subtle but crucial difference with the computer science field of software engineering. We also hope to raise awareness of the importance of software in research, and the vital role RSEs play in creating this software. Besides an online presence, we plan to also hold irregular meetings inviting community members to meet up.\n\n## Fill in the Survey!

Not surprisingly, this results in an ever-increasing need for people to tackle the increasing digitalization of research.\n\nIn the past, people in many different positions within the academic landscape would take care of developing digital tools such as research software. Typically this included many PhD students and postdocs, hence positions with deviating job profiles and non-permanent contracts.\n\nIn view of the rising need for digital expertise and the missing adequate positions and job descriptions within most academic systems, an initiative to establish a dedicated profession of the Research Software Engineer (**RSE**) was started.\n\n![deRSE19 aerial group photo (CC-BY Antonia Cozacu, Jan Philipp Dietrich, de-RSE e.V.)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4096/1*v-AmdN95tAiNrpO9EMc86g.jpeg)*deRSE19 aerial group photo (CC-BY Antonia Cozacu, Jan Philipp Dietrich, de-RSE e.V.)*\n\nThis initiative started in the UK with the [UK Research Software Engineer Association](https://rse.ac.uk/) (see also [the not-so-brief history of RSEs](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-08-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers-0)). Several countries followed and founded RSE organizations including the Netherlands ([NL-RSE](http://nl-rse.org/)) and Germany ([deRSE](http://nl-rse.org/)).\n\nAs [Alys Brett](https://twitter.com/alysbrett) pointed out during her keynote, RSEs sit somewhere in between a researcher and a software engineer. The term RSE is still somewhat vague as it covers a broad spectrum of expertise and activities; there are no universal job specification or career paths defined for RSEs, [although some initiatives are emerging](https://www.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/blog/rse-career-development/).

It still is a long way to go to establish the role of RSEs within the academic landscape. One indicator is the large fraction of non-permanent contracts among RSEs (see bar plots below). Another one is that actual job titles in Germany still show the lack of dedicated positions related to research software engineering (see word clouds below).\n\nIt at first seems as if RSEs in the Netherlands can already rely a better job situation (more permanent positions) and better fitting job titles.

In the Netherlands we believe that a large number of participants working at the eScience Center dominate the statistics.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Plots from (or based on) a 2018 RSE survey.

Given that software is key to modern science, research software should also be FAIR. How can the FAIR principles be applied to software? What should they be? What challenges exist? How do we get there?\n\nThe session featured three talks and a panel discussion, with the session’s speakers as panel members. We used the mentimeter Q&A feature to allow the audience to submit and vote on questions and discussion points for the panel discussion at the end of the session.\n\n## Anna-Lena Lamprecht: Towards FAIR principles for Research Software\n\n![Anna-Lena Lamprecht: Towards FAIR principles for Research Software](/img/fair-software-escience/anna-lena.jpg)\n\nAnna-Lena Lamprecht, assistant professor of Software Technology at Utrecht University, presented the main findings from the paper [“Towards FAIR principles for research software”](https://doi.org/10.3233/DS-190026) that she recently published together with several co-authors from the European eScience community: Software and data share some properties, but they are not the same and hence a differentiated interpretation of the FAIR principles is required.

Many of the proposed changes are effectively a rephrasing by replacing “(meta)data” with “software and its associated metadata”. Other changes extend or reinterpret the FAIR data principles because software, in contrast to data, is of composite nature, needs to deal with dependencies and evolve along with the changing eScience ecosystems, and hence often comes in different versions.\n\nPerhaps the biggest change from the FAIR data principles is in the following principle (a reinterpretation and extension of the original interoperability principle I2):\n\n> “Software use and produce data in types and formats that are formally described using controlled vocabularies that follow the FAIR principles.”\n\nThis is remarkable because it requires FAIR software to only work with FAIR data, whereas FAIR data does not require to have been produced by only FAIR software.\n\nAnna-Lena’s slides are available [here](https://www.slideshare.net/annalenalamprecht/towards-fair-principles-for-research-software/).\n\n## Stephan Druskat: Dare to be mair than just FAIR!\n\n![Stephan Druskat: Dare to be mair than just FAIR!](/img/fair-software-escience/stephan.jpg)\n\nStephan Druskat is an RSE working in linguistics, and researching software sustainability with a focus on software citation. With his talk titled “Dare to be mair than just FAIR!” Stephan challenged us to think beyond only the FAIR principles.\n\nOf course, making digital objects FAIR is a great step in the right direction for research. FAIR enables easier, better, and open science. The momentum that FAIR has gained also allows us to bring other subjects to the attention of policy makers, including research software engineering, and increase the visibility of software sustainability concerns.\n\nHowever, FAIR does not imply openness, FAIR does not ensure credit is given where credit is due, and FAIR does not give any guarantees with regard to quality. Stephan suggests that we should perhaps consider “FAIR PLAY” as the application of FAIR principles to software where useful, augmented with rigorously good practice for research software: open sourcing it per default, licensing it respectively, attributing contributions to it for credit, and asserting adequate quality. FAIR PLAY<sup>1</sup> is essentially the good things of FAIR combined with the good things of RSEing.\n\nAn important part of giving proper attribution is to make your software citable and to cite others when you build upon their work. Stephan and others have developed the [Citation File Format](https://citation-file-format.github.io/), a metadata format for both humans and machines. While these citation files can be read and manually written, there is also an entire toolbox available to support creation, validation, and conversion of CFF files, and automation is on the horizon, with build plugins and automated updates.\n\nStephan’s slides are available [here](https://sdruskat.net/2019-11-21-nl-escience-symposium/).\n\n## Pablo Rodríguez-Sánchez: How software development shaped the way I write science\n\n![Pablo Rodríguez-Sánchez: How software development shaped the way I write science](/img/fair-software-escience/pablo.jpg)\n\nPablo Rodríguez-Sánchez is working as an RSE at the Netherlands eScience Center.

We used the mentimeter Q&#x26;A feature to allow the audience to submit and vote on questions and discussion points for the panel discussion at the end of the session.</p>\n<h2 id=\"anna-lena-lamprecht-towards-fair-principles-for-research-software\"><a href=\"#anna-lena-lamprecht-towards-fair-principles-for-research-software\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Anna-Lena Lamprecht: Towards FAIR principles for Research Software</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"Anna-Lena Lamprecht: Towards FAIR principles for Research Software\" src=\"/img/fair-software-escience/anna-lena.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Anna-Lena Lamprecht, assistant professor of Software Technology at Utrecht University, presented the main findings from the paper <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3233/DS-190026\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“Towards FAIR principles for research software”</a> that she recently published together with several co-authors from the European eScience community: Software and data share some properties, but they are not the same and hence a differentiated interpretation of the FAIR principles is required. For example, one point of ongoing discussion is whether the FAIR principles, which do not demand data to be open, should require software to be open source. Another much-debated relationship has been the one between FAIR and software quality, naturally of great concern in the RSE community. Here it helps to distinguish between form and function of software. FAIR can help to ensure quality of the form of software, but the quality of the functionality of the software goes beyond what FAIR intends to cover.</p>\n<p>After these general considerations, Anna-Lena continued with the proposal for FAIR Guiding Principles for software, taking the FAIR data principles as a starting point. Many of the proposed changes are effectively a rephrasing by replacing “(meta)data” with “software and its associated metadata”. Other changes extend or reinterpret the FAIR data principles because software, in contrast to data, is of composite nature, needs to deal with dependencies and evolve along with the changing eScience ecosystems, and hence often comes in different versions.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest change from the FAIR data principles is in the following principle (a reinterpretation and extension of the original interoperability principle I2):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Software use and produce data in types and formats that are formally described using controlled vocabularies that follow the FAIR principles.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is remarkable because it requires FAIR software to only work with FAIR data, whereas FAIR data does not require to have been produced by only FAIR software.</p>\n<p>Anna-Lena’s slides are available <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/annalenalamprecht/towards-fair-principles-for-research-software/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stephan-druskat-dare-to-be-mair-than-just-fair\"><a href=\"#stephan-druskat-dare-to-be-mair-than-just-fair\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Stephan Druskat: Dare to be mair than just FAIR!</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"Stephan Druskat: Dare to be mair than just FAIR!\" src=\"/img/fair-software-escience/stephan.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Stephan Druskat is an RSE working in linguistics, and researching software sustainability with a focus on software citation. With his talk titled “Dare to be mair than just FAIR!” Stephan challenged us to think beyond only the FAIR principles.</p>\n<p>Of course, making digital objects FAIR is a great step in the right direction for research. FAIR enables easier, better, and open science. The momentum that FAIR has gained also allows us to bring other subjects to the attention of policy makers, including research software engineering, and increase the visibility of software sustainability concerns.</p>\n<p>However, FAIR does not imply openness, FAIR does not ensure credit is given where credit is due, and FAIR does not give any guarantees with regard to quality. Stephan suggests that we should perhaps consider “FAIR PLAY” as the application of FAIR principles to software where useful, augmented with rigorously good practice for research software: open sourcing it per default, licensing it respectively, attributing contributions to it for credit, and asserting adequate quality. FAIR PLAY<sup>1</sup> is essentially the good things of FAIR combined with the good things of RSEing.</p>\n<p>An important part of giving proper attribution is to make your software citable and to cite others when you build upon their work. Stephan and others have developed the <a href=\"https://citation-file-format.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Citation File Format</a>, a metadata format for both humans and machines. While these citation files can be read and manually written, there is also an entire toolbox available to support creation, validation, and conversion of CFF files, and automation is on the horizon, with build plugins and automated updates.</p>\n<p>Stephan’s slides are available <a href=\"https://sdruskat.net/2019-11-21-nl-escience-symposium/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pablo-rodríguez-sánchez-how-software-development-shaped-the-way-i-write-science\"><a href=\"#pablo-rodr%C3%ADguez-s%C3%A1nchez-how-software-development-shaped-the-way-i-write-science\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Pablo Rodríguez-Sánchez: How software development shaped the way I write science</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"Pablo Rodríguez-Sánchez: How software development shaped the way I write science\" src=\"/img/fair-software-escience/pablo.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Pablo Rodríguez-Sánchez is working as an RSE at the Netherlands eScience Center. His talk was about how software development shaped the way he writes about his research.</p>\n<p>With a great example of communication between Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei, Pablo confronted the audience with the fact that, despite great advances in the means of information and communication technology, some parts of scientific communication have not improved over the last four hundred years.</p>\n<p>Pablo defines a scientific paper as a trustworthy and useful piece of encapsulated knowledge, and argues that there are actually many parallels between scientific papers and software. Both should adhere to the properties: consistency, reproducibility, being properly written, having references/dependencies, written by a team, and evolving over time. Instead of only using software development tools to write his paper, Pablo, inspired in what other researchers did before, takes it one step further and writes software packages whose output is the paper.</p>\n<p>Using a combination of markdown and knitr, Pablo writes his papers as software packages in a way that all of the content of the paper, graphs and all can be fully reproduced by others who run the software.</p>\n<p>Pablo’s slides are available <a href=\"https://pabrod.github.io/NLeSC_symp19-en.html#NLeSC_symp19\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"panel-discussion\"><a href=\"#panel-discussion\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Panel Discussion</h2>\n<p>Following the tree talks our speakers gathered on one side of the table for the panel discussion. While Ben was chairing the discussion, James was analyzing the questions that were submitted to mentimeter. The discussion involved questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What does metadata mean in the context of software?</li>\n<li>How to make software dependencies FAIR as well?</li>\n<li>Should FAIR Software imply open source?</li>\n<li>Does FAIR/Open Software conflict with the university’s striving for spin-offs/patents/commercialization?</li>\n<li>The discussions are all quite abstract, what can we do concretely?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anna-Lena, Stephan, Pablo and also several attendees of the session shared their insights, experiences, perspectives and some speculations, making it a lively and inspiring session.</p>\n<p>With regard to the question what to do concretely, Pablo mentioned “that the main bottleneck for FAIR software is, still, much more basic: many researchers who would like to share their code with FAIRness just don’t know how to begin.” In an effort to provide some concrete pointers on where to begin with making software FAIR, the Netherlands eScience Center and DANS developed fair-software.nl, which was officially launched later that day at the symposium.</p>\n<p>If you would like to join the discussion on FAIR Software, the session’s organizers and the speakers of this session will be using the #fair-software on the RSE slack server to continue the discussion on FAIR Software.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><sup>1</sup> In case anyone has been wondering, “FAIR PLAY” of course stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, and Per default open source, Licensed, Attributing contributions to software for credit, and of adequate qualitY.</p>","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1634208733158},"$loki":27},{"slug":"2019-12-02-Looking-back-at-NL-RSE19","layout":"post","image":"/img/nl-rse19/niels.jpg","title":"Looking back at NL-RSE19","date":"2019-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","toc":[{"id":"comments-from-the-participants","depth":2,"text":"Comments from the participants"},{"id":"thanks","depth":2,"text":"Thanks!"},{"id":"outlook-for-nl-rse-2020","depth":2,"text":"Outlook for NL-RSE 2020"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Ben van Werkhoven and Niels Drost (Netherlands eScience Center, NL-RSE)"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The first RSE conference in the Netherlands was held Wednesday 20 November 2019 at the Johan Cruijff Arena Amsterdam!"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Ben van Werkhoven opened the conference and introduced our first speaker, Niels Drost, member of the NL-RSE core team."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Niels gave a brief status update of NL-RSE and some announcements.

Niels explained how important it is to have an RSE conference. As part of this academic career Niels has visited many computer science and domain science conferences, but when visiting the first RSE Conference in the UK in 2016, he suddenly realized that this conference was the first that he had ever attended that was actually organized for him!</p>\n<p>Back at home, Niels wasted no time and started forming a group of people to found NL-RSE, which finally happened in April 2017.

Anyone who identifies as such can consider themselves an RSE, whether you are a researcher who codes, a developer who conducts research, or someone who studies research software.</p>\n<p>Tania also explained that, in general, the role of the RSE within academia is much broader than a researcher who codes or a coder who researches. In addition to developing software, RSEs build communities, manage projects, innovate, teach and mentor others, manage data sets, and conduct research, but they are sometimes also activists, and outcasts within the academic landscape. In general, there are many more people important to academia than the subset of people that are considered Academics.</p>\n<p>It does not matter where you are on the spectrum between software engineering and research. Ever since the RSE movement started, there has been the opportunity for people to self-describe as RSEs.

His discovery of microbes, using the lenses he made himself, created an entire new field of research. He was at the same time a researcher and a tool maker: his research would have not been possible without the tools he built. Leeuwenhoek was well known for both his discoveries in microbiology as well as the unmatched quality of his lenses.</p>\n<p>Four centuries after Leeuwenhoek, research tools have only gained importance. Recently, a new type of tool gained critical importance: research software. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has brought up to the public eye how <a href=\"https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2020-05-07-better-software-better-covid-19-research\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">important research software is</a>.</p>\n<p>However, research software does not receive the recognition it deserves. A group of members of the <a href=\"http://nl-rse.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NL-RSE network</a>, and software minded data specialists, got together in an attempt to raise the profile of research software. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4015242\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our position paper</a> provides further details.</p>\n<p>Back in March 2019, we had a <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2647436\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">meeting with NWO</a> about the role of software in research.

The checklist covers aspects such as documentation and licensing.\n\n**Note**: reusability can be easily confused with another important term: reproducibility. The two are closely related, but not quite the same: the former is an important component of the latter, but software need not be reusable to be reproducible. Roughly speaking and for the purpose of this blog: we talk about reproducibility when the same code and same data are used to produce the same results; we talk about reusability when the same code is used with different data to produce new results (read [detailed discussion](https://github.com/NLeSC/guide/discussions/237)). The software reusability checklist is aimed primarily at reuse, but it may also be applicable to ensure reproducibility of scientific results produced by the use of software.\n\n***\n\nThe following is the set of minimum requirements we defined for code to be **repeatable**, **re-runnable** and **portable**[^reproducibility]:\n\n**The software**:\n - is in an accessible repository, preferably version controlled;\n - has a license (see: ‘The license’);\n - is documented (see: ‘The documentation’).\n\n**The license**:\n - allows for reuse;\n - is compatible with the dependencies’ licenses.\n\n**The documentation**:\n - has installation instructions, including good descriptions of:\n   - the hardware it depends on (e.g. GPUs);\n   - the operating system the software has been tested on;\n   - software requirements (libraries, shell settings, etc).\n - explains usage, specifying:\n   - what the software does;\n   - how it can be used;\n   - what options/parameters are available.\n - contains examples of how to run it.\n\n**Finally**:\n - If the software depends on any sort of data, the data should be available\n\n[^reproducibility]: J.

Minimum requirements list for software reusability\n\n***\n\n\n### eScience Center Reusabilithon\n\nWe had initially planned to hold the Reusabilithon with a relatively large group of eScience engineers, as part of our internal activities. However, with the lockdown affecting our capacity early 2021, we changed our plan. Instead of canceling the event, we decided to carry out the event online, and on a small scale. As a bonus, this helped against the lockdown-induced boredom, by breaking the routine and spending some time doing something interesting and fun!\n\nTwo eScience Center RSEs worked together via Teams for one afternoon. They applied this list to 3 different pieces of software ([sv-callers](https://www.research-software.nl/software/sv-callers), [muscle3](https://github.com/multiscale/muscle3) & [iScore](https://github.com/DeepRank/iScore)) developed in-house. The following are the observations by the engineers in this small reusabilaton:\n\n> It took us about 1 hour per use case working together, and most time was spent getting the example to work. Independently from how each tool did, we found that the minimum requirements list is fit for purpose – no points in the list felt to us as if they should be left out; we also did not feel that there was something missing in this list.\n>\n> One point which we did find challenging: it is not easy to determine at a glance if there are any conflicts with the dependencies of the software. It could be helpful to have a check or remark that dependencies have compatible licenses\n\nThis experience describes an encouraging first experiment. However, it was conducted on a very small scale, and by engineers who were vaguely familiar with the software in question.\n\nAs a follow up, a discussion session during the [NL-RSE meetup](https://nl-rse.org/events/2021-02-11-meetup.html#software-re-usability--what-is-needed) led to the writing of this blog post. The Software Sustainability SIG would like to organise a larger *reusabilithon* with participants from a broader audience and from a wider range of organisations; very similar in format and spirit to the already successful [Reprohack](https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/). However, where the latter focuses on the *reproducibility* of research results, during a reusabilithon participants and aim for reusability. As explained earlier in this post, we understand *reusability* to be using existing code on new data (even if such data is just parameters).\n\nOne of the aims of a future *reusabilithon* is to gather more feedback on the suitability of the current reusability checklist and improve it. The long-term aim of such a list is to provide researchers with a useful tool to be able to improve the reusability of the software they produce.\n\nThe long term aim of running a *reusabilithon* is making RSE's (and researchers writing research code) aware of what reusability is about and to develop their expertise in using tools to improve reusability. In the future, some of the checks in the reusability checklist could be automated by using tools such as [howfairis](https://github.com/fair-software/howfairis), [fairtally](https://github.com/fair-software/fairtally), [fossa open source compliance management](https://fossa.com/product/open-source-license-compliance), [Augur](https://www.augurlabs.io/live-examples/), [GFZ software quality assurance](https://gitext.gfz-potsdam.de/software/services/fair/software-quality-assurance), etc. We expect the reusabilithon can help identify additional tools that can automate some checks. However instead of automating everything from the start, we need to validate that the points in this checklist are indeed useful for software reuse.\n\n### Are you interested in participating in future reusabilithons?

[Paul Konstantin Gerke](https://rse.diagnijmegen.nl/members/paul-konstantin-gerke/), RSE from the diagnostic imaging analysis group (DIAG) at Radboud UMC, gave a demo of the [Grand Challenge](grand-challenge.org). The Grand Challenge is a Python-based platform where researchers and engineers can annotate and analyze medical images to, for example, judge the likelihood that a patient has a COVID-19 infection, based on a CT scan of that patient’s lungs. The platform also allows users to compare their own medical imaging machine learning algorithms to those of others. The Grand Challenge website lists different leaderboards for several “challenges”, or medical imaging machine learning problems, and ranks the performance of competing algorithms for each challenge. \n\n[Casper Kaandorp](http://uva-aias.net/en/staff/casper-kaandorp), RSE from Utrecht University, presented the second demo: NIDM (Networking during Infectious Disease Model). NIDM is an Elixir web application that can be used for running social experiments. Casper demonstrated a social risk-taking behavioral experiment, which consisted of the simulation of an infectious disease spreading through a social network. Study participants are supposed to earn money by befriending others in their network, while minimizing connections with infected individuals. Believe it or not, the app was conceptualized before the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n\nThe demos were followed by a panel, where the meeting chair Carlos Martinez-Ortiz asked the two RSEs how their respective RSE groups are set up, and what challenges they have faced. Below is a summary of their conversation.  <!--break-->\n\n### How is your RSE group set up? \n\n**Paul:** My group is part of the DIAG: the research arm of the Radboud UMC radiology department. The DIAG consists of about 60 people, split up into teams of 5-10 people with different research specialities. The RSE group is one such team. Our RSEs take on work that can address common goals between multiple DIAG research teams. The research team leaders establish common goals in a panel, and the RSE group tries to implement software features in line with the goals communicated by the panel. This is how the RSE group has built the Grand Challenge, a platform that can be useful for all research teams.  \n\n**Casper:** I am part of a group of RSEs that is helping researchers from all backgrounds at the Utrecht University with different kinds of problems, so our approach is broader than what Paul describes. The range of projects we work on is immense, from easy projects like setting up a GitHub repository, to helping people with machine learning projects that are extremely complex.  \n\n### What kind of resources does your RSE group have, and is that enough? \n\n**Casper:** At the moment, funding is not a problem for our team of 10 people. There’s a cap on how many people can work in our group, though. Our team grew in the past months, so our capacity is currently increasing, but we can’t take on new projects too fast, because we never know what kind of project may come to us. Any kind of task can come up, which makes the job interesting, but also unpredictable, and can leave us overwhelmed with work. \n\n**Paul:** Our RSE group is facilitating research funded by NWO. To add features to the platform, we should be fulfilling researcher needs, and working in line with the available funding. There is also another funding stream however: there are industry partners (AWS for example, for cloud expenses) that provide resources. But we also develop and market medical products, which brings in money.  \n\n### Is there a limit on time and budget that you spend on different projects? \n\n**Paul:** We want attach deadlines to feature development, because ever-ongoing projects can be a problem. When you’re given one year to finish a project, that project will be on the backburner, and can forever be pushed back. The time and money we spend on features is determined by what our stakeholders want, and what the panel decides we should work on. For example, a stakeholder may want our software to include Magnetic Resonance (MR) support. We then decide that in order to provide that, we need to implement feature A, B and C. We bring our proposal for feature A, B and C back to the panel, who may tell us to focus on feature A. Then we like to commit a set amount of time to developing feature A.  \n\n**Casper:** At UU, our coordinator tries to put a minimum of 2 people on each project, so no one works alone. Sometimes it is unavoidable for someone to work alone on a project, though. This can be an issue, but when you are with so few people and such a variety of projects, it’s sometimes impossible to structure it differently. We used to have an undefined amount of time for any given project, which often meant that projects would take more than half a year to get done. We now have a rule that a project should be finished within half a year of one person’s full time amount of work. A common challenge we still face is that we may start working on a project, but the researcher who approached us becomes busy with something else, and the project is left for some time. The researcher sometimes comes back and expects the RSEs to pick up where they left off, which is then often impossible.  \n\n### What kind of projects do researchers approach you with?  \n\n**Casper:** We get requests from every kind of researcher there is. Half of those requests lead to nothing, because the researcher isn’t ready yet. A quarter is consultancy and includes helping researchers with questions about how to set up a job on Lisa (HPC system at Utrecht University). These are the type of questions that can be solved in a few days.  \n\nThe last 25% is wild. It can be anything. Recently, there was a researcher who went to the Congo and recorded two types of audio. One of jungle sounds, in the wild, and another of sounds from a monkey sanctuary. They then came to us with the question if it would be possible to create an algorithm that could predict biodiversity in each surrounding based on these recordings. So we helped them to do this.  \n\nI also worked on a project that looked at betting behaviour in sports bets, which is similar in some ways to betting in the context of the stock market. The application we developed browsed bookmaking websites to get a feeling for betting odds in sports matches. The application would bet very heavily on one contestant when the odds were 50/50. The goal of this was to try and see if the application could “swing the market”, so other participants would follow the application’s lead.

I was hoping we’d make some money with it, because during the first two months we won quite a lot! Unfortunately, we lost a lot later on. It was a really interesting project, but not a profitable one.  \n\n**Paul:** The work we do at the DIAG may look very focused, but that was the RSE trick: We stripped all the focus away, and ended up with a generic solution for different fields. We don’t tackle the very specific things anymore. What Casper says is right; with a lot of different projects, it’s easy to get completely overwhelmed and not finish things.

We’re in the East of the Netherlands, and as a hospital, you compete with industry for software engineers who have the skills that you need.

Hospitals are not really known for building software - they’re geared to patient care, and maybe research, but not software development.  \n\nOur future strategy will be to work more as a remote team. We now have had one year of practicing working remotely of course, because of the circumstances in the COVID-19 pandemic. And there are many benefits to RSEs who work with us. The work is meaningful, challenging and interesting, and the hospital is a flexible workplace.  \n\n### Closing remarks \n\nThanks to Casper and Paul for participating in this panel and for sharing their diverse experiences being part of RSE groups. \n\nAre you an RSE working in a group? Is the structure of your group different from what is described here? We would love to hear your experiences! \n","dir":"/posts","path":"/posts/2021-06-16-meetup-april","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-10-14T10:51:01.432Z","updatedAt":"2021-10-14T10:51:01.432Z","bodyHtml":"<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@pluyar?utm_source=unsplash&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Shane Aldendorff</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/mechanism?utm_source=unsplash&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></em></p>\n<p>Authors:<br>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/liekedb\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lieke de Boer</a> / Netherlands eScience Center</p>\n<p>If you’re curious about the kinds of things a Research Software Engineer (RSE) can get done when employed in that capacity, you’d have enjoyed the April 2021 NL-RSE meetup, where we saw the demos of two RSE software projects. <a href=\"https://rse.diagnijmegen.nl/members/paul-konstantin-gerke/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Konstantin Gerke</a>, RSE from the diagnostic imaging analysis group (DIAG) at Radboud UMC, gave a demo of the <a href=\"grand-challenge.org\">Grand Challenge</a>.

De la Cueva is a lawyer, philosopher, and Open Science advocate, with expertise in free software and intellectual property. During the [meetup on Friday, 11 June 2021](/events/2021-06-11-meetup.html), he gave a passionate talk about what the Open Science movement can learn from the Free Software movement, blending the topics of software development and science in a way not unfamiliar to those identifying as RSEs.\n\n<!--break-->\n\nIf anyone&#39;s an expert on these topics, it&#39;s De la Cueva. He switched from Windows to Linux in 2000, after receiving a Blue Screen of Death on his Windows machine – &quot;_Why would you create a wall that doesn&#39;t allow me to understand something I paid for?_&quot;. In 2002, when Wikipedia was planning to commercialize, De la Cueva and others [forked the Spanish version of the page onto a server in the University of Seville, Spain](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/wikipedia-spanish-fork), proving to Wikipedia&#39;s owners that the entire project could be run on non-profit servers – a move some consider responsible for keeping Wikipedia free of commercial ads and paywalls to this day. Later, in 2006, he was, in his own words, &quot;_the first lawyer_ _to obtain a judicial ruling where the term [_copyleft_](https://copyleft.org/) was included_&quot;. For the case in question, [Ladinamo](https://edri.org/our-work/edrigramnumber4-9spaincc/), De la Cueva defended the owners of a bar who were sued for failing to pay the compulsory licensing fee for playing music in their establishment. He won the case by successfully arguing that the music&#39;s Creative Commons licenses allowed for public performance, and that no additional fees had to be paid.\n\nIn 2014, De la Cueva defended his philosophy thesis, [Citizen Technological Pragmatics and Democratic Regeneration](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266487696_Pragmaticas_tecnologicas_ciudadanas_y_regeneracion_democratica) (abstract in English, thesis in Spanish). The work discusses how open access, open science, open data, and open government affect public knowledge and democracy. The thesis reflects Javier&#39;s varied interests, providing insights from the fields of law, technology, political philosophy, and philosophy of language. Today, De la Cueva works as a lawyer and professor at IE University in Madrid. Along with his university teaching activities, De la Cueva is actively involved in science dissemination, &quot;_because a functioning democracy needs its citizens to be informed about scientific development_&quot;. Science, he says, should not be about _who_ does it, but about _what_ scientists are doing. A common sensical enough statement, but one that may sound like an unrealistic utopia to anyone who has ever worked in academia.\n\nAmerican sociologist of science [Robert K. Merton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Merton#Sociology_of_science_and_CUDOS) recognized this tension: he observed that the social system of science works both in agreement with, but also often in contradiction to, its own ideal. Merton expressed the ideal of science in four concrete moral principles, referred to as **CUDOS** : Science must be **C**ommunist (in the sense of communal), meaning that all scientists have common ownership of scientific goods, giving up intellectual property of their work in exchange for recognition. It should be **U**niversal, or independent of the socio-political status and personal attributes of its participants. Scientific institutions should also be **D**isinterested, meaning personal gain of individuals within them is inferior to the greater goal of the scientific enterprise. Lastly, science must have **O**rganised **S**cepticism.\n\nFor science to be in line with CUDOS, we have to rethink the relationship between scientists and their work.
