  - title: Research Data Management, Research Support @ Amsterdam UMC
    url: https://www.amsterdamumc.org/en/research-support/data-management.htm
    research_goal: |
      Research data management (RDM) aims to control the entire data management process along the research lifecycle; from study preparation, data acquisition, data processing and statistical analysis, writing and publishing, to archiving and open data.

      Research data should be organized according the FAIR principles, making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable and, where applicable, additional requirements (e.g. for WMO, GCP and GDPR). It should be well documented, transparent and traceable. Legislation and growing emphasis on issues such as reproducibility, integrity of research and the requirement of subsidy providers for sharing data require specific working procedures, facilities and support.

      All Amsterdam UMC (clinical and non-clinical) researchers can get support on their study preparation, including writing a data management plan, their data collection (including appropriate tooling), preparing data for statistical analysis, and sharing and publication of research data.

      The Research data management departmentâ€™s expertise is translated into policies, education, consultation and executive support, and we are the entrance point for requests for Epic data and setting up an additional data collection for research in Epic.

  - title: Electrophysiology of the heart @ Erasmus MC
    research_goal: At the (cardiac) electrophysiology group at the department of cardiology at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam heart rhythm disorders are studied by means of the analysis of detailed measurements during (open) heart surgery procedures, as well as with laboratory setups. The group is composed of a large part of PhD and Master students from medical and related study areas. Two people develop the main software to record, reduce and analyse the large and growing amount of data.
