# Join NL-RSE

Joining the NL-RSE Community is easy â€“ just [sign up to our mailing list here](https://lists.nl-rse.org/mailman/listinfo/everyone).

## Why join?

By joining the community, you will stay in touch with RSEs in the Netherlands and you can send and receive announcements of events organized by and for RSEs. You will also be informed about our work and will have the chance to contact people
like you from all corners of the research world. The more members that we have, the easier it will be to raise awareness of the importance of software in research, and the vital role RSEs play in creating this software.
