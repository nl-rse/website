## Why use Rust for Research Software?

Have you heard about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)? It is a language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software. Learning a new language may sound like a bit of a time commitment and perhaps intimidating, but it doesn't need to be!

In this meetup our speakers will share their experiences with building research software using Rust. From simple user facing applications, graphical user interfaces, libraries, R and Python bindings, etc. Join us and discover all that Rust can do for your research! Everybody is welcome, even if you have no experience in Rust and only a little in any other language.

## Location
SURF | Hoog Catharijne (Utrecht Centraal)
Moreelsepark 48 3511 EP Utrecht.

## Abstracts

### ~~Talk 1 - Felix Henninger~~

Coming soon!

### Oxidizing a Computational Structural Biology Infrastructure - Rodrigo Vargas Honorato

Coming soon!

### Building dependable libraries for solid science & visualising your science with GUIs - Douwe Schulte

I will share with you what I have learned building scientific libraries for Rust. Mainly focusing on the key aspects of Rust in this context: safe, dependable, fast, and great tooling. Specifically I will detail some design considerations for pdbtbx and rustyms, two libraries I started. In the second part I will highlight a recent project building a GUI using Tauri and rustyms for mass spectrometry visualisations.

### wave2flap // Model basin wave maker control using Rust.
An example on how to translate traditional looping over arrays into an efficient iterator based approach.
