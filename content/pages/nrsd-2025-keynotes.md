Eric-Jan Wagenmakers is a mathematical psychologist and professor at the University of Amsterdam, where he is part of the Psychological Methods Group. He is widely known for his pioneering work in Bayesian statistics, cognitive modeling, and scientific transparency. But during the National Research Software Day, he joins us to share a different kind of story, one that resonates with our community. 

As the founder and guiding force behind JASP, an open-source statistical software platform, Eric-Jan has helped shape a tool that is now used worldwide for both classical and Bayesian analyses. JASP is celebrated for its intuitive interface, modular design, and commitment to accessibility, qualities that make it a favorite among educators, researchers, and students alike. 

Yet behind JASP’s success lies a compelling journey: one of technical innovation, community building, and navigating the realities of academia.  

His insights will speak directly to the heart of our event, how we build, support, and recognize the work of research software engineers, and how we can shape a future where tools like JASP not only survive, but thrive.

Connie Clare is the Community Development Manager at the Research Data Alliance (RDA), a global organization that brings together researchers, data professionals, and policymakers to advance the role of data in science. With a background in developmental biology and a passion for open science, Connie has built a career around empowering communities to collaborate, share knowledge, and improve research data practices. 

In the Netherlands, she has led community-building efforts at 4TU.ResearchData, and now at RDA, she supports a thriving international network of over 16,000 members. 

During the National Research Software Day, Connie will help us in exploring the future of our own community, NL-RSE. Drawing on her experience in global community development, she will help us reflect on what kind of community we want to build together. Her talk sets the stage for our afternoon unconference, where we’ll collectively shape the direction and agenda for the coming year.
