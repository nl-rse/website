# National Research Software Day 2025

Are you working on research software and interested in connecting with colleagues from across the Netherlands? Are you an advocate for the recognition of research software and the people who make it possible? Join us at the National Research Software Day 2025 to showcase and discover software, discuss trends and policies and help shape the NL-RSE community.

At National Research Software Day, researchers, policymakers, Research Software Engineers and community leaders are invited to come together. This event will be held on **25 November 2025** at **Lijm & Cultuur in Delft**.

National Research Software Day 2025 is a joint initiative from NL-RSE, TU Delft and LCRDM. Funding is supplied by TU Delft, LCRDM and Open Science NL. For questions about the event, contact [nrsd2025@tudelft.nl](mailto:nrsd2025@tudelft.nl)

Participation is free of charge, including lunch. The number of available spots is limited. If there is more interest than available spots, a waiting list will be used. 

## Get inspired, get involved! 
After the success of the [first National Research Software Day](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/national-research-software-day-2024/), organised by the eScience Center in 2024, this year's edition will be hosted by TU Delft and take place on 25 November 2025 at Lijm & Cultuur in Delft. This is a day for and by the Research Software Community in the Netherlands. 

The programme is designed to spark both inspiration and action. The morning features a keynote and a range of (interactive) parallel sessions to explore new ideas. In the afternoon, the focus shifts to collaboration and implementation, with a second keynote and unconference sessions that encourage active participation. A significant part of the programme is reserved for sessions led by community members like you. 

An updated version of the programme will be published on this page closer to the date. 

## Submit an abstract for a session

The call for sessions is now open! Submit your proposal for a parallel or unconference session until **5 September 2025**. We use Oxford Abstracts to collect submissions. To submit, you will have to create an account if you do not have one already:

We welcome creative ideas and formats to inspire the community. Lijm & Cultuur is a creative space that allows for unconventional sessions, and they are happy to think along with any session organizers how this can be achieved. If you are interested, details can be discussed with them closer to the event. 

If your abstract is accepted, you are not automatically registered as a participant. Please register for the event even if you submit an abstract.

## Morning: Parallel session 
The morning programme features a one-hour slot for (interactive) parallel sessions aimed at inspiring fellow participants. 
You can submit a proposal for either a: 
* 1-hour interactive session to explore a topic in-depth 
* 15-minute demo/presentation to showcase your work or share a (success) story 

Submissions should address one of the following themes, we have added some example topics for context.

### Technical/Demo 
* Practical tools for software engineering (templates, workflows, AI assistants, etc.)
* Showcases of research software 

### Research Software Training 
* Do you have a success story, newly developed training materials, or important lessons learned that you would like to share with a wider audience?
* Teaching research software engineering effectively to different audiences - what works for whom?

### Professional Development
* The path to expertise: Growing from junior to senior
* Identifying and addressing RSE skill gaps  
* Soft skills in technical roles

### Making a case for Research Software  
* How can we make the impact of research software visible? 
* How can we successfully convey the importance of research software to different stakeholders?
* What strategies have helped you obtain funding for research software projects? Share your tips, strategies, and lessons learned.
* Effective models for collaboration with other institutes, societal partners or industry 

## Afternoon: Unconference sessions 
The afternoon is all about turning inspiration into action. The unconference invites all participants to bring their ideas, questions and challenges to the community. This is your chance to collaborate on the topics that matter most to you, and contribute directly to shaping the NL-RSE community in the year ahead.

Topics will be proposed by participants, either in advance through the call for sessions or on the morning of the event, and selected through an open, participatory process. Together, we aim to create tangible outcomes to shape the goals and priorities for the NL-RSE community, such as: 

* New community events (e.g., workshops, NL-RSE meet-ups, hackathons, coding cafes) 
* Written pieces (opinion pieces, blog posts for NL-RSE website, white papers) 
* New initiatives or special interest groups
* Form new open-source software collaborations

<Collaps title="Location">

The National Research Software Day will take place at [Lijm en Cultuur Delft](https://www.lijmencultuur.nl/). Lijm & Cultuur is a historic industrial site in Delft that operated as a glue and gelatin factory from 1885 until 2002, when it closed due to the BSE crisis. Since 2003, the site has undergone a remarkable transformation, with its preserved monumental buildings now serving as creative spaces for cultural production, hosting everything from art studios and music performances to special events and celebrations.
