# NRSD25 Code of Conduct

The National Research Software Day 2025 is organized to provide a welcoming space where participants can learn about, share, and discuss topics related to research software. The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to foster an environment in which diverse individuals can collaborate and interact in mutual respect. We recognize a shared responsibility to create and maintain such an environment for the benefit of all participants.
To make clear what is expected, all participants (including speakers, exhibitors, organisers and volunteers) are required to agree to and abide by this code of conduct.

## Expected Behaviour
All participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to others throughout the event and through all communication channels, including but not limited to collaborative documents and any other platform used to facilitate the event. All interactions –both online and in person- should be professional.

We encourage participants to:
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Respect people’s boundaries
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Adhere to this Code of Conduct and report any incidents promptly

## Unacceptable Behaviour
The following behaviours are specifically prohibited:
- discriminating, racist, intimidating, harassing, lewd, demeaning, bullying, stalking, or threatening speech or actions;
- any real or implied threat of harm, physical or otherwise;
- unwelcome sexual attention;
- unwelcome physical contact;
- sustained disruption of speakers or events (verbally or physically);
- retaliation against an individual for reporting harassment or other unacceptable behaviours;
- retaliation against an individual for participating in the investigation of a report of harassment or other unacceptable behaviours;
- advocating or encouraging any of the above behaviours;
- falsely reporting harassment or other unacceptable behaviours.

## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, or if you believe a harassment problem exists, please report it as soon as possible to one of our designated Code of Conduct contacts. They will be wearing **yellow lanyards** and are available to help throughout the event.

If the person you should report to is the target of the complaint, you may contact the event organisers, identifiable by a purple lanyard. The target of the complaint will not be involved in handling or resolving the incident. Every report of a Code of Conduct violation will be treated seriously and handled with care.

If no immediate action is required, you can also report a complaint by sending an email to [nrsd2025@tudelft.nl](mailto:nrsd2025@tudelft.nl). These complaints will be carefully reviewed and followed up after the conference.

## Enforcement
Participants who are asked to stop any unacceptable behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Event organisers retain the right to take appropriate actions, including:
- mediation between complainant and alleged perpetrator(s), to reach an amicable resolution;
- issue a verbal warning;
- expel the offender(s) from the event (particularly if a participant’s immediate safety is threatened);
- engage the Programming Committee to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.

The alleged perpetrator(s) will be notified of a complaint as soon as possible and be given a chance to respond to the complaint.
